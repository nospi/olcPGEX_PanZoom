# olcPGEX_PanZoom
Basic Pan/Zoom extension for [olc::PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).
Adapted from javidx9's [panning & zooming tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ8qtAizis4).

# Getting Started
To begin with you'll want to declare an `olc::panzoom` somewhere accessible in your application. A private member variable of your derived PGE class is suitable.

```c++
class MyApp : public olc::PixelGameEngine
{
private:
  olc::panzoom pz;
};
```

The extension requires a pointer to your derived PGE class. You can provide it with one within your `OnUserCreate` method. You can also optionally set the offset with an `olc::vf2d` here. To emulate a euclidean plane with (0,0) at the center, you can set the offset to `(-ScreenWidth() / 2, -ScreenHeight() / 2)`:

```c++
bool OnUserCreate() override
{
  pz.Create(this);
  pz.SetOffset({ (float)-ScreenWidth() * 0.5f, (float)-ScreenHeight() * 0.5f });
}
```

Input handling is left to the user and instead several methods are presented: `StartPan`, `StopPan`, `ZoomIn`, `ZoomOut`, `NudgeLeft`, `NudgeRight`, `NudgeUp`, `NudgeDown`. The extension also provides an `Update` method which must be called once per frame in order to process panning. **NOTE:** the Nudge methods nudge the 'Camera', not the world.

The following basic example implements panning with the middle mouse button, and zooming with the mouse wheel:

```c++
bool OnUserUpdate(float fElapsedTime)
{
  if (GetMouse(2).bPressed)
    pz.StartPan();
  if (GetMouse(2).bReleased)
    pz.StopPan();
  
  if (GetMouseWheel() > 0)
    pz.ZoomIn(1.1f);
  if (GetMouseWheel() < 0)
    pz.ZoomOut(0.9f);
  
  // call the panzoom Update method or panning won't work
  pz.Update(fElapsedTime);
}
```

The `ZoomIn` and `ZoomOut` methods have an optional `float fScaleFactor` argument should you wish to have finer control over the speed of the zoom. Depending on whether keyboard or mousewheel zoom is used you may want to adjust these - the mousewheel moves in discrete steps and requires a larger 'jump'; occurring in a single frame as opposed to keyboard zoom will also effect this.

```c++
if (GetKey(olc::Q).bHeld)
  pz.ZoomIn(1.01f);
if (GetMouseWheel() > 0)
  pz.ZoomIn(1.1f);
if (GetKey(olc::A).bHeld)
  pz.ZoomOut(0.99f);
if (GetMouseWheel() < 0)
  pz.ZoomOut(0.9f);
```

By default, zooming will occur around the mouse cursor. If you'd prefer to disable this and instead zoom around the screen center, there is a second optional `bool zoomToMouse` argument for the `ZoomIn` and `ZoomOut` methods.

```c++
// keyboard zoom on center (not mouse)
if (GetKey(olc::Q).bHeld)
  pz.ZoomIn(1.01f, false);
if (GetKey(olc::A).bHeld)
  pz.ZoomOut(0.99f, false);
```

None of this is of any use unless we use it to transform co-ordinates between world-space and screen-space. This can be performed with the `ScreenToWorld` and `WorldToScreen` methods. The following example converts the top-left and bottom-right of the screen into co-ordinates in world space, and plots the function `y = x` - taking the values from world space and drawing them in screen space.

```c++
olc::vf2d wldTopLeft, wldBottomRight;
pz.ScreenToWorld({ 0, 0 }, wldTopLeft);
pz.ScreenToWorld({ ScreenWidth(), ScreenHeight() }, wldBottomRight);

olc::vi2d previousPos;  // used to draw lines between co-ordinates
for (float x = wldTopLeft.x; x < wldBottomRight.x; x++)
{
  float y = x;                          // perform the basic function y = x
  olc::vi2d scrPos;                     // declare an olc::vi2d to hold our screen pos
  pz.WorldToScreen({ x, y }, scrPos);   // convert from world to screen space
  if (x != wldTopLeft.x)                // if not the first iteration of this loop:
    DrawLine(previousPos, scrPos);      // draw a line between previousPos and current scrPos
  previousPos = scrPos;                 // update previousPos with current scrPos
}
```

There are instances where you may also want to scale a scalar value based on the zoom factor of the panzoom instance - such as calculating the screen-space radius of a circle.

```c++
olc::vi2d scrCirclePos;
int scrRadius;

pz.WorldToScreen({ 0.0f, 0.0f }, scrCirclePos);   // center of circle at origin (0,0) from world space to screen
scrRadius = pz.ToScreenScale(30.0f);              // scale radius of 30.0f in world space to screen-space
DrawCircle(scrCirclePos, scrRadius); 
DrawLine(scrCirclePos, { scrCirclePos.x + scrRadius, scrCirclePos.y });

// and to calculate value at world scale
float wldRadius = pz.ToWorldScale(scrRadius);     // should be close to 30.0f depending on current zoom factor
```

# Example
Please see the `example.cpp` file for a full working demo. Don't forget to `#define OLC_PGEX_PANZOOM` alongside `OLC_PGE_APPLICATION`.
